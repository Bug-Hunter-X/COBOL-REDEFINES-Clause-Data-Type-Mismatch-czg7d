This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the REDEFINES clause in COBOL.  The core issue lies in a data type mismatch when using REDEFINES with different data types. The original code attempts to store a numeric value in a field that's later redefined as a character string, leading to unexpected and potentially incorrect results. The solution clarifies the data type alignment and illustrates the correct way to handle such situations, ensuring data integrity and expected program behavior.
